"""
Store the modified time of the various doxygen xml files against the
reStructuredText file that they are referenced from so that we know which
reStructuredText files to rebuild if the doxygen xml is modified.

We store the information in the environment object as 'breathe_file_state'
so that it is pickled down and stored between builds as Sphinx is designed to do.

(mypy doesn't like dynamically added attributes, hence all references to it are ignored)
