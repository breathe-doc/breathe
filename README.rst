----

Breathe is a Sphinx plugin providing beautifully integrated Doxygen output in
your user-facing documentation. It allows you to combine Doxygen's excellent
technical understanding of your code base with the superb long form
documentation output of the Sphinx system.

For Packagers
-------------

- Breathe packages on PyPI are PGP signed for Breathe >= v4.28.0.
- Breathe tarballs on GitHub are PGP signed for Breathe >= v4.29.0.

Download
--------

Breathe is available from github and `PyPI, the Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/breathe>`_. It can be installed with::

    pip install breathe

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available `here <http://breathe.readthedocs.org/>`__. Thank
you to the people running `Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ for such an
excellent service.

The source for the documentation is in the ``documentation`` folder if you want
to built it and read it locally.

Testing
-------

The testsuite can be run with::

    make dev-test

The documentation also does a good effort of covering the available
functionality with different examples. To build the documentation, run::

    make

This will run doxygen over the example code and then run the Breathe
documentation. View the results at::

    documentation/build/html/index.html

Further to this if you want to compare the current documentation output against
a previous state in order to check for regressions there is a ``compare`` script
in the ``documentation`` folder. It takes two arguments which are two commit
references that you'd like to compare. This means that all your changes have to
be committed first. Also the script does not resolve state dependent references
like ``HEAD`` so provide concrete commit references like sha1s or branch names.
A typical example is to compare your current branch output to master::

    # Make sure all your changes are committed first
    cd documentation
    ./compare master my-branch

This will do a checkout and build at each commit and then run ``meld`` against
the resulting directories so you can see the differences introduced by your
branch.

Requirements
------------

Breathe requires Python 3.8+, Sphinx 4.0+ and Doxygen 1.8+.
