Breathe's documentation
=======================

Breathe provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen documentation systems.

It is an easy way to include Doxygen information in a set of documentation
generated by Sphinx. The aim is to produce an autodoc like support for people
who enjoy using Sphinx but work with languages other than Python. The system
relies on the Doxygen's xml output.

      This documentation is built from the latest `Breathe github project
      <https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe>`_ code. It does not necessarily
      reflect a released version of Breathe on PyPI.

.. ifconfig:: documentation_build == 'development'

   .. warning::

      This build of the documentation is not from a specific tagged release of
      Breathe. It reflects a work in progress state of Breathe. Please see the

Overview
--------

* **Simple setup** - one doxygen config value, one Sphinx config value and one
  directive and you'll be on your way.
* **High and low level directives** - reference the whole project, just a class
  or just a function with different directives.
* **Support for multiple doxygen projects** - set it up to be aware of different
  projects and reference them by name or path for each directive.
* **Allows embedded reStructuredText in doxygen markup** - some extra doxygen
  aliases allow you to add ``\rst`` - ``\endrst`` blocks to your comments and
  have the contents interpreted as reStructuredText.
* **Basic support for Sphinx domains** - Link to functions in the breathe output
  with a standard Sphinx domain reference.

In a Nutshell
-------------

You write code that looks a little like this:

.. literalinclude:: code/nutshell.h
   :language: cpp

Then you run this::

   doxygen

With a setting that says this::

   GENERATE_XML = YES

Then in your Sphinx documentation, you add something like this::

   .. doxygenclass:: Nutshell
      :project: nutshell
      :members:

With a ``conf.py`` setting like this::

   breathe_projects = {
       "nutshell":"../../examples/specific/nutshell/xml/",
       }

And Breathe registered as an extension in ``conf.py`` like this::

   extensions = [ "breathe" ]

You get something like this:

----

.. doxygenclass:: Nutshell
   :project: nutshell
   :members:
